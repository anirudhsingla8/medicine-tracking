# Implementation Notes: Medicine Tracker Backend - Phase 2 Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to implement Phase 2 enhancements for the Medicine Tracker Backend, focusing on:
1. Renaming the existing `medicines` table to `user_medicines`
2. Creating a new `global_medicines` table for storing global medicine details
3. Implementing soft deletion for medicines
4. Updating all related APIs to work with the new table structure

## Database Changes

### Table Renaming
- The existing `medicines` table has been renamed to `user_medicines` to better reflect its purpose of storing user-specific medicine entries.
- Added a `composition` column to store an array of objects representing the medicine's composition (name, strength_value, strength_unit).
- Added a `form` column to indicate the type of medicine (Tablet, Syrup, Capsule, Injection, Ointment, Powder, Drops, Inhaler).

### Soft Deletion Implementation
- Added a `status` column to the `user_medicines` table with a default value of 'active'
- Added a constraint to ensure the status is either 'active' or 'inactive'
- All DELETE operations now perform soft deletion by setting the status to 'inactive' instead of permanently removing records
- All GET operations automatically filter to only show medicines with 'active' status

### Global Medicines Table
- Created a new `global_medicines` table to store comprehensive medicine information that can be shared across all users
- The table includes fields for:
  - Basic information (name, brand_name, generic_name)
  - Dosage details (dosage_form, strength)
  - Manufacturer information
  - Medical details (indications, contraindications, side_effects, warnings, interactions)
  - Storage instructions
  - Category and classification codes (ATC code)
  - Regulatory information (FDA approval date)

## API Changes

### Medicine Routes (`routes/medicines.js`)
- Updated all endpoints to work with the renamed `user_medicines` table
- Implemented soft deletion across all DELETE endpoints
- Added filtering by 'active' status to all GET endpoints
- Enhanced security by verifying profile ownership in addition to user ownership
- Added support for the `composition` field in CREATE and UPDATE operations
- Added support for the `form` field in CREATE and UPDATE operations

### New Global Medicines Routes (`routes/global_medicines.js`)
- Created new endpoints for managing global medicine information:
  - POST /api/global-medicines - Create a new global medicine entry
  - GET /api/global-medicines - Retrieve all global medicines
  - GET /api/global-medicines/:id - Retrieve a single global medicine by id
  - PUT /api/global-medicines/:id - Update a global medicine by id
  - DELETE /api/global-medicines/:id - Delete a global medicine by id

### Server Integration
- Updated `server.js` to mount the new global medicines routes at `/api/global-medicines`

## Migration Script

A migration script (`migration-script.sql`) has been created to:
1. Rename the existing `medicines` table to `user_medicines`
2. Add the `status` column with default value 'active' to `user_medicines`
3. Add the `composition` column to `user_medicines` table
4. Add the `form` column to `user_medicines` table
5. Add constraints and indexes for the `status` column
6. Create the new `global_medicines` table with all necessary fields and indexes
7. Update foreign key constraints to reference the renamed tables

## Security Enhancements

- All medicine-related endpoints now verify both user ownership and profile ownership
- Soft deletion ensures that medicine records are never permanently lost
- The new global medicines table allows for centralized medicine information that can be shared across all users

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding search functionality to the global medicines API
- Implement caching for frequently accessed global medicine information
- Add synchronization mechanisms between user medicines and global medicines
- Consider adding versioning to global medicines for tracking updates
